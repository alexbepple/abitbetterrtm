"Small improvements for [Remember The Milk][rtm] interface"

Features
--------

A Bit Better RTM changes the way Remember The Milk looks and works when you login to their site. Among other things, it:

* moves the list of task lists to a column on the left, and removes the tabs cluttering the top
* adds keyboard shortcuts that help you quickly navigate lists, add list, move tasks, and search
* adds a task count next to the name of each list
* provides a unique URL for each list and task that you can bookmark or paste into an email
